# Test Verbosity Features
# This file demonstrates the new verbosity capabilities in Robogo

testcase: "Verbosity Test"
description: "Test file to demonstrate verbosity levels and output"

# Global verbosity setting (applies to all steps unless overridden)
verbose: "basic"

steps:
  # Basic verbose output (inherits from global setting)
  - name: "Basic verbose log"
    action: log
    args: ["This step will show basic verbose output"]
  
  # Override with detailed verbosity
  - name: "Detailed verbose HTTP request"
    action: http_get
    args: ["https://httpbin.org/get"]
    verbose: "detailed"
    result: get_response
  
  # Override with debug verbosity
  - name: "Debug verbose variable operation"
    action: variable
    args: ["set_variable", "test_var", "debug_value"]
    verbose: "debug"
    result: set_result
  
  # Disable verbosity for this step
  - name: "Silent operation"
    action: log
    args: ["This step will be silent (no verbose output)"]
    verbose: false
  
  # Use boolean true for basic verbosity
  - name: "Boolean verbose"
    action: sleep
    args: [0.5]
    verbose: true
  
  # HTTP with custom headers and verbose output
  - name: "Verbose HTTP with headers"
    action: http
    args: ["POST", "https://httpbin.org/post", '{"test": "data"}', {"Content-Type": "application/json"}]
    verbose: "detailed"
    result: post_response
  
  # String operations with verbose output
  - name: "Verbose string concatenation"
    action: concat
    args: ["Hello", " ", "World", " ", "from", " ", "Robogo"]
    verbose: "detailed"
    result: greeting
  
  # Time operations with verbose output
  - name: "Verbose time operation"
    action: get_time
    args: ["iso"]
    verbose: "detailed"
    result: timestamp
  
  # Assertions with verbose output
  - name: "Verbose assertion"
    action: assert
    args: ["${greeting}", "Hello World from Robogo", "Greeting should match expected"]
    verbose: "detailed"
  
  # Random number with verbose output
  - name: "Verbose random number"
    action: get_random
    args: [100]
    verbose: "debug"
    result: random_num
  
  # Final summary
  - name: "Final summary"
    action: log
    args: ["Verbosity test completed! Check the output above for different verbosity levels."]

# Verbosity Levels Demonstrated:
#
# 1. Global verbosity: "basic" - applies to all steps unless overridden
# 2. Step-level verbosity: "detailed" - overrides global setting
# 3. Boolean verbosity: true (same as "basic")
# 4. Disabled verbosity: false - turns off verbose output
# 5. Debug verbosity: "debug" - maximum detail level
#
# Expected Output:
# - Basic: Shows action name and duration
# - Detailed: Shows args, duration, and output
# - Debug: Shows everything plus verbosity level
# - False: No verbose output (normal operation)
