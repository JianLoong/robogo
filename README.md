# Robogo

A simple, modern test automation framework written in Go. Robogo provides a clean YAML-based DSL for writing test cases with support for HTTP APIs, databases, messaging systems, file operations, and more.

**Shift-Left Testing**: Robogo enables developers to run comprehensive end-to-end tests early in the development cycle with clear, readable test definitions that improve collaboration between development and testing teams.

## Security Features

### Environment Variables
```yaml
variables:
  vars:
    # Secure credential management
    db_url: "postgres://${ENV:DB_USER}:${ENV:DB_PASSWORD}@${ENV:DB_HOST}:${ENV:DB_PORT}/${ENV:DB_NAME}"
    api_token: "${ENV:API_TOKEN}"
```

### Sensitive Data Masking
```yaml
steps:
  # Automatic masking of password fields
  - name: "Login request"
    action: http
    args: ["POST", "/auth/login"]
    options:
      json:
        username: "testuser"
        password: "${ENV:USER_PASSWORD}"  # Automatically masked in logs
    result: auth_response
    
  # Custom field masking
  - name: "API call with secrets"
    action: http
    args: ["GET", "/secure-data"]
    options:
      headers:
        X-API-Key: "${ENV:SECRET_API_KEY}"
        X-Session-Token: "${session_token}"
    sensitive_fields: ["X-Session-Token"]  # Custom masking
    result: secure_data
    
  # Complete logging suppression
  - name: "Highly sensitive operation"
    action: http
    args: ["POST", "/admin/reset-passwords"]
    no_log: true  # No step details logged at all
    result: reset_result
```

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24+
- Docker & Docker Compose (for services)

### Development Services

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Services available:
# - PostgreSQL: localhost:5432 (user: robogo_testuser, pass: robogo_testpass, db: robogo_testdb)
# - Kafka: localhost:9092  
# - Spanner Emulator: localhost:9010
# - HTTPBin: localhost:8000
# - SSH Server: localhost:2222 (user: testuser, pass: testpass)
```

### Environment Configuration

Create `.env` file for secure credential management:
```bash
# Database credentials
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=robogo_testuser
DB_PASSWORD=robogo_testpass
DB_NAME=robogo_testdb

# API credentials
API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
API_TOKEN=your_secret_token_here

# SSH credentials for SCP testing
SSH_PASSWORD=testpass
```

### Database Setup

**PostgreSQL** - Use environment variables for credentials:
```yaml
variables:
  vars:
    db_url: "postgres://${ENV:DB_USER}:${ENV:DB_PASSWORD}@${ENV:DB_HOST}:${ENV:DB_PORT}/${ENV:DB_NAME}?sslmode=disable"

steps:
  - name: "Test database connection"
    action: postgres
    args: ["query", "${db_url}", "SELECT version()"]
    result: db_version
```

**Google Cloud Spanner** - Set up emulator:
```bash
# After starting docker-compose
# Linux/Mac:
SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9010 ./setup-spanner.sh
# Windows:
.\setup-spanner.ps1
```

## Example Tests

The **[examples/](examples/)** directory contains 50+ comprehensive test examples organized by complexity and feature:

### Quick Examples
```bash
# HTTP testing (no services required)
./robogo run examples/01-http-get.yaml

# Database testing (requires docker-compose up -d)
./robogo run examples/03-postgres-basic.yaml

# SCP file transfer testing
./robogo run examples/23-scp-simple-test.yaml

# Messaging systems
./robogo run examples/05-kafka-basic.yaml

# Security features
./robogo run examples/19-no-log-security.yaml
```

### Example Categories
- **Beginner**: Basic HTTP, database, and file operations
- **Intermediate**: Multi-step workflows, environment variables, data extraction
- **Advanced**: Complex control flow, retry logic, nested operations
- **Expert**: Security-aware testing, production-ready patterns

## Architecture

### KISS Principles
Robogo follows **Keep It Simple and Straightforward** architecture:

- **No Dependency Injection**: Direct object construction throughout
- **No Over-abstraction**: Simple, direct implementations
- **Minimal Interfaces**: Only where absolutely necessary
- **Strategy Pattern**: Clean execution routing for different step types

### Execution Flow
1. **CLI** receives command and parses YAML test file
2. **TestRunner** creates execution environment with variables and strategy router
3. **ExecutionStrategyRouter** routes steps based on priority:
   - **ConditionalExecutionStrategy** (Priority 4): Handles `if` conditions
   - **RetryExecutionStrategy** (Priority 3): Handles `retry` configuration
   - **NestedStepsExecutionStrategy** (Priority 2): Handles `steps` arrays
   - **BasicExecutionStrategy** (Priority 1): Handles simple actions
4. **Actions** perform actual operations and return structured results
5. **Results** are processed, masked for security, and displayed

For detailed architecture documentation, see **[internal/README.md](internal/README.md)** and **[docs/execution-flow-diagram.md](docs/execution-flow-diagram.md)**.

## Error Handling

### Dual Error System
- **ErrorInfo**: Technical problems (network failures, syntax errors, etc.)
- **FailureInfo**: Logical test failures (assertion failures, unexpected responses)

### Structured Error Messages
```yaml
# Technical error example
steps:
  - name: "Invalid database query"
    action: postgres
    args: ["query", "invalid://connection", "SELECT 1"]
    # Results in ErrorInfo with connection details and suggestions

# Logical failure example  
  - name: "Assertion failure"
    action: assert
    args: ["${response.status}", "==", "200"]
    # Results in FailureInfo showing expected vs actual values
```

## Shift-Left Testing Benefits

Robogo enables **true shift-left testing** by allowing developers to:

### For Developers
- **Run Full E2E Tests Locally**: Complete integration tests with databases, messaging, and external APIs
- **Clear Test Intent**: YAML format makes test logic immediately visible and understandable
- **Fast Feedback**: Quick test execution with immediate connection handling
- **Easy Setup**: Simple environment setup for comprehensive testing

### For Teams
- **Improved Collaboration**: QA and developers can read and modify the same test definitions
- **Living Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specifications of system behavior
- **Early Bug Detection**: Catch integration issues before they reach staging environments
- **Reduced Testing Debt**: E2E tests written during development, not as an afterthought

### Example: Developer Workflow
```bash
# 1. Run relevant tests during development
./robogo run tests/user-registration-flow.yaml
./robogo run tests/payment-processing.yaml

# 2. Validate changes before commit
./robogo run tests/critical-paths.yaml

# 3. Run in CI/CD pipeline
./robogo run tests/smoke-tests.yaml
```

## Parallel Execution

Robogo is designed for **test-level parallelism** (multiple test files) rather than **step-level parallelism** (steps within a test):

```bash
# Run multiple tests in parallel
./robogo run test1.yaml & \
./robogo run test2.yaml & \
./robogo run test3.yaml & \
wait
```

**Why Sequential Steps?** Steps within a test are intentionally sequential because they represent a logical flow where later steps depend on earlier results:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: "Create user"
    action: http
    args: ["POST", "/users", "..."]
    result: response
    
  - name: "Verify user created"  # This DEPENDS on the above step
    action: assert
    args: ["${response.status}", "==", "201"]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service connection errors**: Ensure Docker services are running (`docker-compose ps`)
2. **Environment variable issues**: Check `.env` file exists and variables are properly formatted
3. **SCP/SSH connection issues**: Verify SSH server is running and credentials are correct
4. **Variable resolution errors**: Check `${variable}` syntax and variable names
5. **Database connection errors**: Verify Docker services are healthy

### Debug Tips

- Use `log` actions to inspect variable values
- Check Docker service logs: `docker-compose logs <service>`
- Use shorter timeouts for faster feedback during development
- Enable verbose logging for debugging complex variable substitution

### Getting Help
