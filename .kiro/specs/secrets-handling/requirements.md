# Secrets Handling Requirements

## Introduction

Robogo needs secure secret management to handle sensitive data like API keys, database passwords, and authentication tokens without exposing them in YAML test files or logs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Environment Variable Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to reference environment variables in my test files so that I can keep secrets out of version control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `${ENV:SECRET_NAME}` syntax THEN the system SHALL substitute the value from the environment variable
2. WHEN an environment variable is not set THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message
3. WHEN environment variables contain sensitive data THEN they SHALL NOT appear in logs or error messages
4. WHEN using environment variables THEN the substitution SHALL work in all variable contexts (args, options, variables)

### Requirement 2: Secure Variable Masking

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want sensitive values to be masked in logs and error messages so that secrets are not exposed during test execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a variable is marked as sensitive THEN its value SHALL be masked as `***` in all output
2. WHEN displaying step arguments containing secrets THEN sensitive values SHALL be replaced with `[MASKED]`
3. WHEN errors occur with sensitive data THEN error messages SHALL mask the sensitive portions
4. WHEN logging test results THEN sensitive variable values SHALL NOT be displayed

### Requirement 3: Secret Detection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically detect common secret patterns so that I don't accidentally expose sensitive data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variable names contain common secret keywords THEN they SHALL be automatically treated as sensitive
2. WHEN variable values match common secret patterns THEN they SHALL be automatically masked
3. WHEN API keys, tokens, or passwords are detected THEN they SHALL be flagged as sensitive
4. WHEN users want to override detection THEN they SHALL be able to explicitly mark variables as non-sensitive

### Requirement 4: Configuration-Based Secrets

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to configure secret sources centrally so that team members can run tests without managing individual environment variables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a `.robogo-secrets` file exists THEN the system SHALL load secrets from it
2. WHEN secrets are loaded from files THEN the files SHALL be excluded from version control by default
3. WHEN multiple secret sources exist THEN environment variables SHALL take precedence over files
4. WHEN secret files are missing THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance

### Requirement 5: Secure Logging

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want to ensure that secrets never appear in logs, even during debugging, so that sensitive data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verbose logging is enabled THEN sensitive values SHALL still be masked
2. WHEN debugging variable substitution THEN secret values SHALL show as `[SECRET]`
3. WHEN test results are saved THEN sensitive data SHALL be redacted from output files
4. WHEN errors contain sensitive data THEN stack traces SHALL mask the sensitive portions

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing Robogo user, I want my current tests to continue working unchanged while gaining access to new secret features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing tests use regular variables THEN they SHALL continue to work without modification
2. WHEN no secrets are used THEN there SHALL be no performance impact
3. WHEN upgrading to secret-enabled version THEN existing YAML files SHALL remain valid
4. WHEN secret features are not used THEN logging behavior SHALL remain unchanged
