# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving error handling, assertion reporting, and debugging capabilities throughout the Robogo test automation framework. The current implementation has inconsistent error formatting, limited debugging information, and potential security issues with format string handling. This enhancement will provide better error messages, consistent formatting, and improved debugging experience for users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want consistent and clear error messages across all actions, so that I can quickly understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any action fails THEN the error message SHALL follow a consistent format with action name, context, and specific failure reason
2. WHEN an assertion fails THEN the error message SHALL clearly show expected vs actual values with proper formatting
3. WHEN a variable substitution fails THEN the error message SHALL indicate which variable could not be resolved and in what context
4. WHEN an action receives invalid arguments THEN the error message SHALL specify which argument is invalid and what was expected

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want secure error handling that prevents format string vulnerabilities, so that the framework is safe to use in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating error messages THEN the system SHALL use safe string formatting methods that prevent format string injection
2. WHEN user input is included in error messages THEN it SHALL be properly escaped and sanitized
3. WHEN dynamic error messages are created THEN they SHALL not use variable format strings with user-controlled content
4. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL validate format strings at compile time where possible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want enhanced assertion failure reporting with detailed context, so that I can debug test failures more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an assertion fails THEN the system SHALL provide the actual value, expected value, operator used, and data types involved
2. WHEN a numeric comparison fails THEN the system SHALL indicate whether numeric or string comparison was used
3. WHEN a contains assertion fails THEN the system SHALL show a snippet of the actual content around potential matches
4. WHEN an assertion fails in a loop THEN the system SHALL include iteration context and loop variables

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want improved debugging information for variable resolution, so that I can troubleshoot complex variable substitution issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variable substitution fails THEN the system SHALL show the original template, attempted variable name, and available variables
2. WHEN expression evaluation fails THEN the system SHALL provide the expression that failed and the evaluation error
3. WHEN nested variable access fails THEN the system SHALL show the access path and where it failed
4. WHEN variables are set or modified THEN the system SHALL optionally log variable changes for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want structured error information that can be programmatically processed, so that I can build tooling around test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL include structured metadata like error codes, categories, and context information
2. WHEN assertion failures happen THEN they SHALL include machine-readable comparison details
3. WHEN action failures occur THEN they SHALL include the action name, step context, and failure classification
4. WHEN multiple errors occur in a test THEN they SHALL be aggregated with proper categorization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a framework developer, I want a centralized error handling system, so that error formatting and handling is consistent across all actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN actions need to create errors THEN they SHALL use a centralized error creation system
2. WHEN error messages are formatted THEN they SHALL use consistent templates and formatting rules
3. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL follow a standard logging format with appropriate levels
4. WHEN new actions are added THEN they SHALL automatically inherit consistent error handling behavior
